# CS50x FINANCE - FLASK

![imagem](https://github.com/teltomas/cs50x_projs/assets/120340998/56fcaf82-6e33-4293-a8da-a1d55c0681a0)

This is the last CS50x course problem set, albeit with some differences of my own.

The problem in itself is a little bit simpler, you can check their requests [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/9/finance/).

Although their request is to create individual sections in the app to buy and sell "stock shares" just by searching for a share Symbol, I've changed it in a way that the user is able to buy and sell the shares directly from the main route and/or from the quote section.
Other changes were the inclusion of the NASDAQ100 Index directly in the Quote section, the Funds Management section, and a Settings section that allows the user to change the access password.
